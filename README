Points

Points is a Bukkit Minecraft server plugin that provides /home, /spawn, and
warp points functionality for users.

Commands
--------

/home -- Teleport to your home point, if set
/sethome -- Sets your home point to your current location
/spawn -- Teleports you to the spawn point for the current world
/warp -- The command through which you manipulate warps
/points -- Admin informational functions

Permissions
-----------

Points is written to the built-in Bukkit permissions API (Superperms).
It exports the following permissions nodes:

points.spawn -- Access to the spawn command (default true)
points.home -- Access to the home and sethome commands (default true)
points.warp -- Access to the warps functionality (default true)
points.admin -- Access to admin functionality in /points (default op)

Licensing
---------

See the file called LICENSE.

Dependencies
------------

Points depends on FlatDB, which is a flatfile database API. It can be
obtained here: http://www.github.com/s0lder/FlatDB

Place the jar for FlatDB in the lib/ in your build directory. The script
here is set to include the FlatDB jar on the classpath, as well as to
bundle it with the produced jar.

Building
--------

I use Apache Ant to handle my builds. You'll have to install Ant if you
want to build Points. The process is fairly simple. In order to build
Points, all you need is the latest FlatDB (above) and a Bukkit API
jar (http://ci.bukkit.org). Make a lib/ directory, place the two
jars in it, and then execute: 
  'ant clean build jar' 
 A dist/ directory containing the resulting jar, will be created.
